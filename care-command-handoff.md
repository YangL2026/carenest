## PROJECT SUMMARY

**Project name:** Care Command
**What it is:** A Progressive Web App (PWA) for solo caregivers managing medical care
for multiple dependents (elderly parents, children, etc.)
**Who it's for:** Built for personal use by two households (the builder's family of 5,
and a friend who cares for 3 elderly parents + a child)
**Why it exists:** Every caregiver app on the market (CareClinic, Medisafe, CareZone,
Caring Village, etc.) was tested firsthand and found inadequate — either broken UX,
aggressive upselling, or architecturally designed for "one patient + many caregivers"
instead of "one caregiver + many patients"

---

## CORE FEATURES (in priority order)

1. **Multi-dependent profiles** — Each person has a name, color code, optional photo
2. **Medication management** — Each dependent has a list of medications with name,
   dosage, frequency, scheduled times, and notes
3. **Daily toggle checklist ("Today" screen)** — Shows all medications due today,
   grouped by time of day, color-coded by dependent. Each med is a tappable checkbox
   that records a timestamp when checked. Progress indicators per time block.
   Paused medications show as grayed-out with reason.
4. **Master calendar** — Week/day view showing all dependents' appointments overlaid,
   color-coded. When a procedure prep is active, shows a colored block overlay.
5. **Procedure prep timeline builder** — User enters a procedure date/time, then adds
   timeline entries as rows (offset from procedure time + instruction text). System
   calculates absolute times, sends push notifications at each milestone, and
   automatically pauses/resumes linked medications on schedule.
6. **Push notifications** — Web Push API via service worker. Medication reminders at
   scheduled times, follow-up nudges if not checked off within 30 min, procedure
   prep countdown alerts for critical steps.

## TECH STACK (all decisions final)

| Layer | Technology | Version | Notes |
|-------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Framework | Next.js | 14+ (App Router) | NOT Pages Router |
| Language | JavaScript (not TypeScript for simplicity) | ES2022+ | May migrate to TS later |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | 3.x | Mobile-first responsive |
| Database | Supabase | Free tier | Postgres, 500MB limit |
| Hosting | Vercel | Free tier | Includes cron jobs |
| Notifications | Web Push API | — | VAPID keys, no Twilio/SMS |
| Package manager | npm | — | Not yarn, not pnpm |

**Explicitly NOT using:**
- TypeScript (keep it simple for learning)
- Native iOS/Android (PWA only)
- Any paid API (no OpenAI/Claude API calls in the app)
- SMS/Twilio (push notifications only)
- Firebase (using Supabase instead)
- Any CSS framework other than Tailwind (no Bootstrap, no Material UI)

```

## ACCESS CONTROL MODEL

- No traditional login/password (for simplicity)
- Each household gets a unique key (random string, e.g., "a7x9k2m")
- URL pattern: carecommand.vercel.app/h/{household_key}
- All database queries filter by household_key
- All dependents, medications, etc. belong to a household_key
- If auth is needed later: add Supabase Auth with "Sign in with Google"

---

## BUILD APPROACH

**Two-track strategy:**

**Track 1: Working prototype (build first)**
- Build a minimal but fully functional version end-to-end
- Ugly UI is fine — purpose is to prove architecture works
- Must demonstrate: database CRUD, daily checklist, push notifications
- This gives confidence that the full build will work

**Track 2: Tutorial rebuild (learn by building)**
- 7 phases, each a self-contained lesson
- Each phase produces a working increment
- Styled and polished from Phase 1 onward
- Can reference the prototype when debugging

## TUTORIAL PHASES

| Phase | Name | What's Built | Key Concepts |
|-------|------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | Hello Beautiful Screen | Static Today checklist, hardcoded data | HTML, Tailwind, responsive design, PWA manifest |
| 2 | Make It Think | Interactive checkboxes, state | React, useState, components, event handling |
| 3 | Make It Remember | Supabase connected, data persists | Database, CRUD, async/await, env variables |
| 4 | Make It Know Everyone | Multi-dependent, calendar | Dynamic routing, data joins, calendar UI |
| 5 | Make It Warn Me | Push notifications working | Service workers, Web Push API, cron jobs |
| 6 | Make It Handle Crises | Procedure prep timeline | Complex forms, time math, state machines |
| 7 | Make It Shine | Polish, PDF export, README | Error handling, accessibility, portfolio |

---

## CURRENT STATUS

**Phase:** Not started
**Last completed:** Project planning and market research
**Blockers:** None
**Next step:** Decide whether to start with Track 1 (prototype) or Track 2 (Phase 1 tutorial)

## DECISIONS LOG (append, never delete)

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-03-05 | PWA, not native app | $0 cost, no App Store needed, works cross-platform |
| 2026-03-05 | Next.js + Supabase + Vercel | All free tier, one language (JS), strong portfolio signal |
| 2026-03-05 | No login, household key URL | Minimal friction for 2-household personal use |
| 2026-03-05 | Push notifications, not SMS | $0 ongoing cost, sufficient for personal use |
| 2026-03-05 | JavaScript, not TypeScript | Learning project, reduce complexity |
| 2026-03-05 | Prototype-first, then tutorial rebuild | De-risk architecture before investing in structured learning |
